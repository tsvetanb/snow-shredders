        <p>July 15-21, 2019, Steep-N-Deep Powder Tours and Beyond the Boundaries are partnering for an all-women’s snowboard tour in the Chilean Andes. For the fourth year in a row, BTBounds will head to South America with SND for a unique 7-day trip that combines snowboarding and cultural exploration, including four days of snowboarding, one day exploring Santiago, one day exploring coastal city Valparaiso, and one day surfing in the South Atlantic. Experience Chilean culture both in its mountains and cities with BTBouds and Steep-N-Deep!</p>
        <p>Most of the week, the all-ladies crew will be based in the town of Farellones, a hamlet nestled in the peaks of the Andes providing quick access to three of Chile's most famous resorts, La Parva, El Colorado, and Valle Nevado. This edition of BTBounds builds on the freestyle weekend camps by taking park skills into a big mountain setting in the Chilean Andes. Focus is on riding all mountain terrain, navigating steeps, groomers, and powder. Also included is an intro to backcountry safety and avalanche awareness to provide the necessary resources to safely navigate terrain outside the resort boundaries. Ian Gil, Steep-N-Deep founder and native Chilean, provides an unparalleled immersion into his country’s culture and environment. Ride the best runs, find the best snow, eat the best empanadas, and enjoy a pisco sour or Chilean red wine at the end of each day. Beyond the Boundaries’ Christine Savage, Mary Walsh, and one more staff member, TBD, provide BTBounds on hill guiding the entire week.</p>

        <p>The tour is all-inclusive with lodging, lift tickets, meals, and special activities (airfare and adult beverages are the only things not included). Snowboarding at multiple resorts is on the itinerary and because shredding all day is only one of the ways to experience a new country, the BTBounds x Steep-n-Deep Chile trip includes cultural tours in Chile's cities, wine tasting, nightlife, and a day surfing on the coast (lesson and equipment included). It's an incredible way to experience Chile and its mountains while progressing your snowboarding!</p>
